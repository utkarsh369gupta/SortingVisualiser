# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, built with React and TypeScript. It helps users understand how sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort work by visualizing each step of the sorting process.

## Project Outcomes

- **Educational Tool**: Provides an interactive way to learn and understand different sorting algorithms by observing their operations step by step.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Allows users to compare the efficiency and behavior of different sorting algorithms in real-time.
- **Customizable Speed**: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process in slow motion or at a faster pace.
- **Random Array Generation**: Generate a new array of random values to visualize different sorting scenarios.
